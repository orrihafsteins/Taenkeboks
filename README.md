# Taenkeboks

This repository contains a solution that plays [Tænkeboks](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A6nkeboks_(terningspil)). It is pretty general though and was made with the goal in mind for the back end to support a large class of turn based multiplayer games with partial information.

The running solution can be accessed [Here](https://taenkeboks.azurewebsites.net/Identity/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2F)

It started as an attempt to cheat at a Tænkeboks tournament at the [Golden Lion](https://www.facebook.com/thegoldenliondk/) but became a larger project for fun and education. The attempt to cheat at the Tænkeboks tournament was not fruitful.

It has the following features.

- Game rules implemented in F#
- Web back end and asyncronous API using C# asp.net core 3.1
- GUI implemented using javascript/jquery/bootstrap
